A good unit test suite should aim to:
- Test the function's behavior for a wide range of possible inputs
- Test edge cases that the author may not have foreseen
- Take advantage of the features of `pytest` to make the tests easy to write and maintain
- Be easy to read and understand, with clean code and descriptive names
- Be deterministic, so that the tests always pass or fail in the same way

To help unit test the function above, list diverse scenarios that the function should be able to handle (and under each scenario, include a few examples as sub-bullets).
